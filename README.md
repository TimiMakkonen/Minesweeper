# Basic Minesweeper game on console

The purpose of this program is to see/show/test if I can program a minesweeper game on my own.

---

### Note

I have made sure not to look up codes of any other minesweeper programs prior making this program. Hence this program and the methods used in it to make it work are all completely 'original'. (I only copied concept/rules of the game.)
Throughout making this program, I have only googled:
* some small syntax related questions to know how to make things work the way I want them to,  and
* some other small 'wrong input' related methods.

---

### Note2

BE WARNED! Code is messy for now. It should look better after next update.

### Version History:

##### Version 2:

* Fixed some visual mistakes and made the game look prettier 
* Added automatic mine check for squares around, when choosing a grid location with no surrounding mines.
* Fixes input for 2 digit numbers.
* Initial losing screen.
* More convenient input system.
* + Background work to make next additions/fixes easier to implement.

##### Version 1:


Initial version of the game. Mostly in working condition.


### Fixes and features left to implement:

* Increasing current maximum gridsize from 26.
* Separating column and row size to allow 'non-square' grids.
* Making sure incorrect inputs are less likely to cause bugs.
* Making the game look prettier.
* Making sure that you cannot lose on the first turn.
* Better losing screen.
* Win screen and win conditions.
* Add instructions menu.
* Edit input system overall.
* Add an option to add mines by percentage, not by quantity.
