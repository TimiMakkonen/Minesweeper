# Basic Minesweeper game on console

The purpose of this program is to see/show/test if I can create a minesweeper game on my own.

I have made sure not to look up any other minesweeper program code prior making this program. Hence this program and the methods used in it to make it work are all completely original. (I only copied concept/rules of the game.)
Throughout making this program, I have only googled some small syntax related questions to know how to make things work the way I want them to.

This program, (and this README,) are not finished yet, but they are mostly in working condition. It should take me only few hours of work to 'finish' the program to the way I want it to be.
